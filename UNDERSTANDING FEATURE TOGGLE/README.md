# Introduction

A software is made up of different features. We often need to make changes to an application that involves adding or modifying features. While making these changes there is always risk of bugs or unintended consequences that can affect the stability of an application.One way to mitigate this risk is to use different environments for development and production, such as a staging or testing environment. This allows developers to test new code before it is deployed to production, and ensure that it is working as intended.

However, even with these safeguards in place, it can still be challenging to manage the lifecycle of features and remove them when they are no longer needed. A technique like feature toggle can help to simplify this process by allowing developers to enable or disable specific features in an application without requiring a full deploy. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as rolling out new features to a subset of users or disabling features that are no longer needed.
In this micro byte, we will explore the benefits of using feature toggle and learn how to implement and use it in a software application.

# What is feature toggle

Feature toggle, often reffered as feature flag or feature switch. With help of feature toggle we can enable or disable certain features in a application without requiring a full deploy. Feature toggle makes it easier to manage lifecycle of a features.Feature toggle is typically implemented with help of flag, when the flag is enabled, the feature is available to users. When the flag is disabled, the feature is not available to users. This allows developers to quickly and easily enable or disable features without requiring a full deploy of the codebase.

## Different applications of feature toggle

Consider a scenario where you are working on a feature which take almost a month to get complete, your team follows trunk-based development so other members of the team are also working on same branch as you are working on. Now, when new changes are pushed to production the feature you are working on will also get deployed even though it is not complete yet. You can avoid this feature toggle to your component and disable flag whenever you are deploying the code. So with the help of feature toggle the incomplete feature won't be accessible to users.

Apart from the above scenario there are many potential applications for feature toggle in software development. Few of them are:
