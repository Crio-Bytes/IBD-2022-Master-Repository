# Introduction

If you have a task that may take long time to complete, such as reading data from file or making a network request, you may want to perform the task concurrently, rather than sequentially. This can be achieved with help of Asynchronous programming. With help of Asynchronous programming you can continue running your program while waiting for task to complete.

In Javascript you can achieve Asynchronous programming with help of callbacks, Promises, and async/await. In this micro-byte we will learn:

# What is Promise in JS?

A Promise in JavaScript is an object that is used to represent outcome of an asynchronous operation. The outcome can either represent a failure or completion of an asynchronous operation.

Imagine that you are waiting for a package to be delivered. You might tell the delivery person, "I promise to be home by 4:00 PM to receive the package." This promise represents your intention to fulfill a particular action (being at home by 4) at some point in the future.

Similarly, a Promise in JavaScript represents the intention to perform a particular action (an asynchronous operation) at some point in the future.
