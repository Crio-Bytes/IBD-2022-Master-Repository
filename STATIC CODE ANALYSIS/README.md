# Introduction

Code analysis is a process of analyzing source code in order to detect potential issues, defects or areas of improvement in source code. Code analysis is used to identify a wide range of issues, including syntax errors, bugs, security analysis and style violation.

Code analysis can be classified into two main categories: static code analysis and dynamic code analysis. In this micro byte you will understand what is static code analysis, we will learn how to use SonarCloud to improve quality, security and maintainability of your code.

# What is Static code analysis?

Static code analysis is process of analyzing code without actually executing it. Static code analysis is important for improving quality, security and efficiency of software development. There are different tools available for performing static code analysis. There tools typically parse the source code, perform various checks, analyze the code and repote any issues that they find. In this micro byte we will be using SonarCloud for performing static code analysis.

## Why is static code analysis important?

Static code analysis is an important part of the software development process as it helps to identify and fix problems before they become more difficult and costly to address. There are various benefits of static code analysis, a few of them are:

- Identifying and fixing errors and defects in the code.
- Improving the maintainability and readability of the code.
- Ensuring that the code adheres to certain coding standards and best practices.
- Detecting and mitigating security vulnerabilities in the code.
- Improving the performance of the code.

## What is SonarCloud?

SonarCloud is a cloud-based static code analysis tool that enables developers to analyze their code for quality, security and maintainability issues.
