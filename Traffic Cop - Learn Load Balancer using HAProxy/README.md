# Introduction

How does Google manage to respond to our query within seconds? Good question! Most users of the web are unaware of the sheer scale of the search engine responsible for bringing content across the Internet. The boom in the digital revolution has resulted in increased usage of the Internet with Google facing the heat of the increasing demand in terms of million requests per second to serve their loyal customers.

Sites like Google which bring in high-volume traffic may inadvertently be faced with frequent server upgrades, so that page speed and, in turn, usability, doesn’t suffer for their loyal customers. Often, however, simple hardware upgrades aren’t enough to handle the vast traffic that some sites draw.

So how do Google ensures that it won’t burst into figurative flames as page visits skyrocket? The concept of Load Balancing comes into picture.

> **Load balancing** refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool.
