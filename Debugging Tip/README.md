# Introduction
### What is Debugger?
Debugging is an essential skill for any software developer. It allows you to identify and fix errors in your code, improving the quality and reliability of your software. 


<img src="./images/debug.jpg">


Here are some tips for becoming a better debugger:

- **Understand the problem**: Before you start debugging, try to understand the problem you are trying to solve. This will help you focus your efforts and come up with a plan for how to fix the problem.

- **Use a debugger**: A debugger is a tool that allows you to pause the execution of your code and examine the state of the program at that point in time. This can help you identify the cause of an error and fix it.

- **Print debug messages**: Print statements can be helpful for understanding the flow of your code and the values of variables. Use them to output information about your program and identify where errors are occurring.

- **Use logging frameworks**: Logging frameworks allow you to log messages and events at different levels of severity (e.g., debug, info, warning, error). These messages can be saved to a file or displayed in the console, and they can help you understand what is happening in your program.

- **Test and debug**: Use testing techniques (e.g., unit testing, integration testing) to identify and fix errors in your code. This can help you catch problems early in the development process and prevent them from becoming more difficult to fix later on.

- **Seek help**: If you are stuck or can't figure out the problem, don't be afraid to ask for help. You can ask a colleague, search online, or post your question on a forum or online community.

- **Practice**: The more you practice debugging, the better you will become. So, don't be afraid to experiment and try out different approaches to solving problems.

### In this byte we will study:
- How to debug NPE effectively?
- Come up with 5 examples for NPE: 
    - ***Autowiring done incorrectly***
    - ***Passed parameter is NULL***
    - ***Object not initialized***
    - ***Multi-object deferencing throwing NPE***
    - ***Incorrect casting***

# Activity 1: About NPE
<hr />

### What is NPE?
A NullPointerException (NPE) is a runtime exception that occurs when an application attempts to use an object reference that has a null value. In other words, it occurs when you try to call a method or access a property of an object that is null.

NPEs are often caused by programming mistakes, such as forgetting to initialize an object or misusing method chaining. They can be difficult to debug because they often do not provide much information about the cause of the error. To fix an NPE, you need to identify the root cause of the error and correct it.

For example, consider the following code:
```
String str;
System.out.println(str.length()); // NPE
```

In this code, we are trying to access the length() method of the str object. However, the str object has not been initialized, so it has a null value. This will cause an NPE to be thrown because you cannot call a method on a null object.

They can be difficult to debug because they often do not provide much information about the cause of the error. To fix an NPE, you need to identify the root cause of the error and correct it.

Here are five examples of situations that could cause a NullPointerException (NPE):

- ***Object not initialized***
- ***Multi-object deferencing throwing NPE***
- ***Incorrect casting***

# Activity 2: Autowiring done incorrectly
<hr />

If you are using autowiring in a Spring application, and you have not configured the beans correctly, it could lead to an NPE. For example, if you are autowiring a bean by type, and there are multiple beans of the same type, Spring will throw an NPE.

```
@Autowired
private MyService myService;

// In another class
@Autowired
private MyService myService;
```

In this example, we have two classes that are both autowiring a bean of type MyService. However, we have not defined any beans of this type in our Spring configuration, so when Spring tries to autowire the beans, it will throw an NPE.

To overcome this NPE, you can define a bean of type MyService in your Spring configuration. You can also specify which bean to autowire by using the @Qualifier annotation.
```
@Bean
public MyService myService() {
  return new MyServiceImpl();
}

@Autowired
@Qualifier("myService")
private MyService myService;

// In another class
@Autowired
@Qualifier("myService")
private MyService myService;
```

## Micro-Challenge:

- Have you defined any beans of type **`MyService`** in your Spring configuration?
- Are you using the correct autowiring strategy?
- How does Spring determine which bean to autowire in a given situation?
- What is the **`@Qualifier`** annotation and how can it be used to specify which bean to autowire?

# Activity 3: Passed parameter is NULL

<hr />
If you pass a null value as a parameter to a method, and the method tries to access a property or call a method on the null object, it will throw an NPE.

```
public void processData(Data data) {
System.out.println(data.getValue()); // NPE if data is null
}

// In another class
Data data = null;
processData(data); // NPE
```

In this example, we are passing a null value as a parameter to the processData() method. Inside the method, we are trying to access the getValue() method of the data object. However, if the data object is null, it will throw an NPE because you cannot call a method on a null object.

To overcome this NPE, you can check for a null value before accessing the object's properties or methods.

```
public void processData(Data data) {
  if (data != null) {
    System.out.println(data.getValue());
  }
}

// In another class
Data data = null;
processData(data); // No NPE
```

## Micro-Challenge:

- Have you checked for null values before accessing an object's properties or methods?
- What are some ways you can handle null values in your code to avoid NPEs?
- How can you design your code to prevent null values from being passed as parameters?
- What are some best practices for handling null values in your code?

# Activity 4: Object not initialized
<hr />
If you try to access a method or property of an object that has not been initialized, it will throw an NPE.

```
Data data;
System.out.println(data.getValue()); // NPE

```

In this example, we are trying to access the getValue() method of the data object. However, the data object has not been initialized, so it has a null value. This will cause an NPE to be thrown because you cannot call a method on a null object.

To overcome this NPE, you can initialize the object before accessing its properties or methods.

```
Data data = new Data();
System.out.println(data.getValue()); // No NPE
```

## Micro-Challenge:

- Have you initialized the object before trying to access its properties or methods?
- What are some ways you can initialize an object in your code?
- How can you design your code to prevent null values from being accessed?
- What are some best practices for initializing objects in your code?

# Activity 5: Multi-object deferencing throwing NPE
<hr />

If you chain together multiple method calls or object references, and any of the intermediate objects are null, it will throw an NPE.
```
InputParam inputParam = new InputParam();
System.out.println(inputParam.getGeoLocation().getLatitude()); // NPE if inputParam.getGeoLocation() is null
```

In this example, we are trying to access the getLatitude() method of the GeoLocation object returned by inputParam.getGeoLocation(). However, if the inputParam.getGeoLocation() method returns a null object, it will throw an NPE because you cannot call a method on a null object.

To overcome this NPE, you can check for null values before accessing the object's properties or methods.
```
InputParam inputParam = new InputParam();
GeoLocation geoLocation = inputParam.getGeoLocation();
if (geoLocation != null) {
  System.out.println(geoLocation.getLatitude());
}
```

## Micro-Challenge:

- Have you checked for null values before accessing an object's properties or methods?
- How can you design your code to prevent null values from being accessed in a chain of object references?
- What are some best practices for handling null values in your code?

<hr />

# Activity 6: Incorrect casting
<hr />
If you try to cast an object to a class that it is not an instance of, it will throw a ClassCastException.
```
Object obj = new Object();
String str = (String) obj; // ClassCastException
```

In this example, we are trying to cast the obj object to a String class. However, obj is not an instance of the String class, so it will throw a ClassCastException.

To overcome this ClassCastException, you can check the type of the object before casting it.
```
Object obj = new Object();
if (obj instanceof String) {
  String str = (String) obj;
}
```

## Micro-Challenge:

- Have you checked the type of the object before casting it?
- What are some ways you can check the type of an object in your code?
- How can you design your code to avoid incorrect casting?
- What are some best practices for handling object casting in your code?

# Conclusion 
NullPointerExceptions (NPEs) are runtime exceptions that occur when an application attempts to use an object reference that has a null value. They are often caused by programming mistakes, such as forgetting to initialize an object or misusing method chaining. NPEs can be difficult to debug because they often do not provide much information about the cause of the error. To fix an NPE, you need to identify the root cause of the error and correct it.

To avoid NPEs, it is important to design your code to handle null values properly. This can involve checking for null values before accessing an object's properties or methods, initializing objects before using them, and handling null values appropriately in chains of object references. By following best practices for handling null values, you can prevent NPEs and improve the reliability of your application.
