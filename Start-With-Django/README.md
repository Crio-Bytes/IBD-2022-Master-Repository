## What is Django?
- Django is a Python framework that makes it easier to create web sites using Python.
- Django takes care of the difficult stuff so that you can concentrate on building your web applications.
- Django emphasizes reusability of components, also referred to as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and comes with ready-to-use features like login system, database connection and CRUD operations (Create Read Update Delete).
## How does Django works?
- Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template).
    - **Model** - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.
    - **View** - A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.
    - **Template** - A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.

### Creating a project in Django
- There are two main terminologies when it comes to django : 
    - `Project` : The main directory which is created once the server starts successfully.
    - `App` : One or many Apps (or even zero) make a project in Django.
- So , the first step is to create a project.
- One can run the following command : \
`django-admin startproject <Project-name>`
- Refer to this `SampleProject` created : [Sample Project](Start-With-Django/SampleProject)

### Starting Django Server
- Once the project is created , we can start the server! (Django makes it all so easy ðŸ˜Š)
- The command to start the server is `python manage.py runserver`
- The default template provided by Django is rendered when the server starts : \

- Run the server on a different port `8080`

### Creating an APP in django
- Let's create an app in the `SampleProject`
- To create an app one can use the command `python manage.py startapp SampleApp` where **SampleApp** is the name of the app created.
- Once the app is created one has to add the app name in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list present in the **settings.py** file.
